# TowerOfHanoi
A program that solves the famous Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The program asks the user for the number of discs that they want to move, and the program will output the moves required to move all discs from peg A to peg C (given that there are only 3 pegs labelled A, B, and C) whilst following the rules of the puzzle. The solutions given are optimal.
