# TowerOfHanoiSolver  
A program that solves the famous Tower of Hanoi puzzle. The program asks the user for the number of discs that they want to move, and the program will output the moves required to move all discs from peg A to peg C (given that there are only 3 pegs labelled A, B, and C) whilst following the rules of the puzzle. The solutions given are optimal.  
  
# TowerOfHanoiVisualiser  
A graphical program where the user can experiment with the famous Tower of Hanoi puzzle themselves, or watch the series of moves required to solve the puzzle. The pegs can be selected by using the number keys, and selecting a peg will either take the top disc from that peg, or place down the currently held disc onto that peg. Keep in mind that you cannot place a smaller disc onto a larger disc. The controls for this program are as follows:  
-num key 1 / 2 / 3 - selects the first / second / last peg.  
-up / down - increases / decreases the number of discs respectively and resets the puzzle.  
-s - toggles auto-solve mode.  
-left / right - decreases / increases the speed of the auto-solve mode.  
-r - resets the speed of the auto-solve mode to 10.  
-escape - closes the program.
